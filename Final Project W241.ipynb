    "We were motivated in figuring out what makes quality of data collected from crowdsourcing platforms better.

We know how important the **quality of human labeled data can be for various supervised machine learning algorithm.**\n",

    "**Motivation for Pilot 1:** Contributors can easily log into the Figure8 platform to take tests without reading instructions, which would be our form of delivering treatment as we wanted to vary instructions to see their effect on contributors' scores. Therefore, we launched pilot 1 to understand how likely it was that contributors would actually read instructions. **To test this, we placed an 'attention check' within the instructions in addition to a basic set of instructions that would be provided to everyone.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Specfically, our attention check for pilot 1 asked for contributors to select a specific answer (\"Positive\") to a question (\"This is a lion\") if encountered. We define here that a contributor has read instructions by looking to see if they answered this attention check correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first pilot consisted of using short product reviews to be categorized as positive or negative sentiment. We initially chose this dataset due to its simplicity in understanding the English language. Furthermore, product reviews did not seem to need any specific knowledge regarding particular fields. \n",

It is unknown how Figure8 decides the trust value of contributors, but it should be noted that test administrators (such as ourselves) do not have access to this trust metric beforehand. Furthermore, we made sure to turn off the setting in Figure8 that specifies particular channels within specific regions of the world for distribution or any characteristics (such as trust) that could skew our population in any way. Lastly we depict the distribution of our contributors' trust scores, indicating that most of them were of fairly high trust scores. We will continue to show the distribution of the contributors' trust values to make sure that experiment results will not be biased due to weaker contibutors."

    "From pilot 1, we learned the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time of launch affects the contributor pool and which part of the world they come from.**\n",
    "* Only some workers only received attention check questions and hence: \n",
    "    * For subsequent experiments, we randomized the units before uploading to the platform. \n",
    "    * We included attention check questions when calculating the scores for each contributor.\n",
    "* **Nearly everyone got the attention check question correct.** This could mean either (1) everyone read the instructions; (2) People somehow deduced that it was a positive experience when seeing a product review that mentioned a lion. **This forced us to rethink what an attention check should consist of. Primarily, we learned that our attention check--if any--should not have the chance of being left to subjective interpretations.** \n",
    "* **Our sentiment analysis questions were too easy, thus leaving almost no room for improvement using treatments.** "

    "Motivation for Pilot 2: Given our lessons learned from pilot 1, we decided on using a different set of questions--this time, asking contributors to label whether there were images present in an image. We downloaded a set of images that varied in difficulty which also consisted of various animals in different environments. To mix up the images, we also included pictures of without animals. Examples of our images included snails, butterflies, chameleons, and leaves. \n",

    "The images were downloaded from a third source and therefore we did not have answer labels available at the time of the second pilot. This unfortunately meant that we were unable to score our participants in pilot 2. We'd like to note that we had launched pilot 2 with the intention of solely seeing how contributors would perform with image categorization compared to sentiment analysis. In particular, we wanted to know if the images would generate higher variance amongst responders as opposed to the sentiment analysis where almost everyone got their answers correct. \n",

    "In the code block below, we examine that the agreement distribution for pilot 1 was on average 94% while the agreement distribution for pilot 2 was on average almost 91%. There is also a larger standard deviation in agreement for pilot 2 (15.8%) in comparison to pilot 1 (12.5%). We also note that the 25th percentile of agreement scores for pilot 1 was already 100% while pilot 2's 25th percentile of agreement scores was at 87%. From this, we conclude that pilot 2's image cateogrization questions did induce higher variability amongst results for our contributors. "

We do not know how these trust scores are calculated, but they vary from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest possible indication of how 'trustworthy' a contributor is (i.e. they will not be the type of contributor that randomly clicks answers just to get payment). Furthermore, test administrators like us do not have the ability to filter out contributors based on this trust metric; this trust metric is practically unknown to us until after the results from the test have been published."

    "\n",
    "* It almost looks like both our treatment groups performed worse on average compared to our control group. For example, we see the public good and evaluation treatment groups performing nearly 3 percentage points lower than the control group.\n",
    "* Out of those who did receive the attention check ('Received Compliance?' column == Y), roughly 75% of them did comply. For example: 37 of the people in control received the attention check, and 28/37, or roughly 75%, of these people did correctly answer the attention check question. \n",
    "* While we do not know how Figure8 calculates 'trust' scores for their contributors, we would like to note that the average trust scores across all 3 groups was roughly similar. When comparing those who did and did not rececive attention check questions, the trust scores again look fairly similar, indicating that there most likely was not any selection bias in Figure8's platform in serving attention checks to specific people. \n",
    "* As mentioned before, we are not able to defend the exclusion restriction assumption, but it is worth noting that for those who did receive attention check questions AND answered correctly, their average scores in general did look to be higher than those who did receive attention check questions AND answered incorrectly. While we are not able to tell if this is due to actually receiving treatment or not, it is certainly worth thinking that general attentiveness is still a good bolster for score accuracy. "

    "In Table 2 above, we replicate the same summary statistics as in Table 1, but this time we drop repeaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When tabulating repeaters, we noticed the following: \n",
    "* 10 contributors took both the control and public good tests. \n",
    "* 7 contributors took both the control and evaluation tests. \n",
    "* 23 contributors took both the public good and evaluation tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "This led to **40 repeaters total.** \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible concern would be that these repeaters could have 'learned' the test questions, and therefore improved their scores. We would argue **non-persistence**, as based on the earlier assumptions in this report. **In particular, it is highly unlikely that a repeating contributor would get the exact same set of questions as their previous test given that we provided such a large test bank of 232 questions. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, given that each test was fairly short (less than 1 minute), it is highly unlikely that there is any lingering effect amongst contributors who take more than 1 test.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for non-persistence, we would like to highlight the following: \n",
    "* The number of people (even after dropping the repeaters) who received compliance questions still stays roughly around 50%.\n",
    "* Average scores and their standard deviations in general do not seem to change much across all 3 experiments even after dropping the repeaters. \n",
    "* On average, we still see a 70% compliance rate amongst those who did receive compliance questions. We do see some fluctuations (i.e. in the evaluation group, we see 20 out of the 28 people who received compliance questions answer the compliance question correctly, thus resulting in a 71% compliance rate). However, this change is certainly fairly small. \n",
    "* The biggest portion of repeated contributors came from those who repeated both the public good and evaluation tests (both are treatment groups). If these contributors did \"learn\" from their previous test experience, we would expect repeaters' scores to be higher. By dropping the repeaters to produce the summary stats in Table 2 above, we would expect that the average scores for the public good and evaluation group to be lower than Table 1. We can see, however, that after dropping the repeaters, average scores did not show particular declines across the board for those who did or did not get compliance questions in the public good and evaluation groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also check if there is selection bias amongst those who are repeaters. A natural worry is that repeaters are perhaps 'greedy' for money and therefore are not exactly trustworthy contributors. Again, we examine below the histogram of the distribution of trust within our sample after dropping repeaters. Thankfully, it does not look like repeaters came from any particular strata of 'trustworthy' contributors. "
