    "Motivation for Pilot 1: Contributors can easily log into the Figure8 platform to take tests without reading instructions, which would be our form of delivering treatment. Therefore, we launched pilot 1 to understand how likely it was that contributors would actually read instructions. To test this, we placed an 'attention check' within the instructions in addition to a basic set of instructions that would be provided to everyone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specfically, our attention check for pilot 1 asked for contributors to select a specific answer (\"Positive\") to a question (\"This is a lion\") if encountered. We define here that a contributor has read instructions by looking to see if they answered this attention check correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first pilot consisted of using short product reviews to be categorized as positive or negative sentiment. We initially chose this dataset due to its simplicity in understanding the English language. Furthermore, product reviews did not seem to need any specific knowledge regarding particular fields. \n",

It is unknown how Figure8 decides the trust value of contributors, but it should be noted that test administrators (such as ourselves) do not have access to this trust metric beforehand. Furthermore, we made sure to turn off the setting in Figure8 that specifies particular channels within specific regions of the world for distribution or any characteristics (such as trust) that could skew our population in any way. Lastly we depict the distribution of our contributors' trust scores, indicating that most of them were of fairly high trust scores. We will continue to show the distribution of the contributors' trust values to make sure that experiment results will not be biased due to weaker contibutors."

We do not know how these trust scores are calculated, but they vary from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest possible indication of how 'trustworthy' a contributor is (i.e. they will not be the type of contributor that randomly clicks answers just to get payment. We chose to observe the distribution of trust scores amongst those who did and did not get compliance questions to see if Figure8 was intentionally (or unintentionally) giving specific types of people compliance questions. \n",

We do see some fluctuations (i.e. in the evaluation group, we see 20 out of the 28 people who received compliance questions answer the compliance question correctly, thus resulting in a 71% compliance rate). However, this change is certainly fairly small. \n",
    "* The biggest portion of repeated contributors came from those who repeated both the public good and evaluation tests (both are treatment groups). If these contributors did \"learn\" from their previous test experience, we would expect repeaters' scores to be higher. By dropping the repeaters to produce the summary stats in Table 2 above, we would expect that the average scores for the public good and evaluation group to be lower than Table 1. We can see, however, that after dropping the repeaters, average scores did not show particular declines across the board for those who did or did not get compliance questions in the public good and evaluation groups. \n",

A natural worry is that repeaters are perhaps 'greedy' for money and therefore are not exactly trustworthy contributors. Again, we examine below the histogram of the distribution of trust within our sample after dropping repeaters. Thankfully, it does not look like repeaters came from any particular strata of 'trustworthy' contributors. "
