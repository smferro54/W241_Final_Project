    "We were motivated in figuring out what makes quality of data collected from crowdsourcing platforms better.

We know how important the **quality of human labeled data can be for various supervised machine learning algorithm.**\n",

    "**Motivation for Pilot 1:** Contributors can easily log into the Figure8 platform to take tests without reading instructions, which would be our form of delivering treatment as we wanted to vary instructions to see their effect on contributors' scores. Therefore, we launched pilot 1 to understand how likely it was that contributors would actually read instructions. **To test this, we placed an 'attention check' within the instructions in addition to a basic set of instructions that would be provided to everyone.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Specfically, our attention check for pilot 1 asked for contributors to select a specific answer (\"Positive\") to a question (\"This is a lion\") if encountered. We define here that a contributor has read instructions by looking to see if they answered this attention check correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first pilot consisted of using short product reviews to be categorized as positive or negative sentiment. We initially chose this dataset due to its simplicity in understanding the English language. Furthermore, product reviews did not seem to need any specific knowledge regarding particular fields. \n",

It is unknown how Figure8 decides the trust value of contributors, but it should be noted that test administrators (such as ourselves) do not have access to this trust metric beforehand. Furthermore, we made sure to turn off the setting in Figure8 that specifies particular channels within specific regions of the world for distribution or any characteristics (such as trust) that could skew our population in any way. Lastly we depict the distribution of our contributors' trust scores, indicating that most of them were of fairly high trust scores. We will continue to show the distribution of the contributors' trust values to make sure that experiment results will not be biased due to weaker contibutors."

    "The images were downloaded from a third source and therefore we did not have answer labels available at the time of the second pilot. This unfortunately meant that we were unable to score our participants in pilot 2. We'd like to note that we had launched pilot 2 with the intention of solely seeing how contributors would perform with image categorization compared to sentiment analysis. In particular, we wanted to know if the images would generate higher variance amongst responders as opposed to the sentiment analysis where almost everyone got their answers correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, do keep in mind that Figure8 is a crowdsourcing platform that seeks to provide a final 'consensus' label (the majority label) for the questions you administer in a test. Each question's 'consensus' label is provided with an **'agreement' score**--essentially the ratio of contributors who labelled the questions and agreed with each other on the majority label vs contributors who did not agree with the majority label. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, we examine that the agreement distribution for pilot 1 was on average 94% while the agreement distribution for pilot 2 was on average almost 91%. There is also a larger standard deviation in agreement for pilot 2 (15.8%) in comparison to pilot 1 (12.5%). We also note that the 25th percentile of agreement scores for pilot 1 was already 100% while pilot 2's 25th percentile of agreement scores was at 87%. From this, we conclude that pilot 2's image cateogrization questions did induce higher variability amongst results for our contributors. "

A natural worry is that repeaters are perhaps 'greedy' for money and therefore are not exactly trustworthy contributors.
